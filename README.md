## General Info
"The Last Chapter" is a dynamic web application that was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React/Redux. The application features a home page with five sliders that represent the five most popular genres of books. When a user clicks on a book, they are taken to a separate page where they can access more information about the book.

Additionally, users have the option to add the book to their To Be Read (TBR) list on the more info page. The application also includes a Discover page where users can search for books by title, author, subject, and more, and add them to their TBR list. Finally, users can scroll through their TBR list and delete books from the list as desired. "The Last Chapter" offers users an interactive and engaging way to discover, track, and organize their reading preferences.
