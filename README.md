## General Info
As someone with a passion for reading, my vision for this website was for reader to have a colorful space to discover new books and create a TBR (To Be Read) list to keep track of what they have and have not read. This website utilizes the Google Books API to organize books by genre and provide a Google Review rating so the use can see how popular a book is.
	
## Tech Stack
Project is created with:
* HTML/CSS
* React/Redux

## Minimum Viable Product
The minimum viable product for this project was a web page that displayed the top 5 book genres and popular books within each category. The use could then add and delete books to/from their To Be Read List.

## Stretch Goals To Be Completed
* Adding a search bar so that users can search by book title and/or author
* Creating a shar feature where users can shar their TBR list with friends
* Creating a rating system where users can write reviews and rate book on a scale of 1-5 and add it to different lists according to ratings.
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../lorem
